[+]NOTES FOR THE HACKERS
[+]undetectable-rev-shell
Reverse shells allow attackers to bypass network security mechanisms like firewalls. 
Attackers can achieve reverse shell capabilities via phishing emails or malicious websites.
If the victim installs the malware on a local workstation, it initiates an outgoing connection to the attacker's command server.
